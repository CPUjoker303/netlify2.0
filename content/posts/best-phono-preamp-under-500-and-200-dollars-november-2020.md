The black Tube max S2 box has two pairs of common type replaceable ecc83 tubes which are installed already on it and you can easily swapping them out when you want. On the bottom, you can see switches which we use for changing the input preamps capacitance and these switches are used for the typical setting impedance of that phono cartridge which you are using with your turntable. 

You can also check to set it using instruction book. On the front you will see some six preamps gain controls steps with led light signals and next to it there you can see small subsonic filter button which will use for rolling of frequencies when you turn it on. By using this subsided subsonic filter you can roll-off the frequencies below 20 Hz for cutting any low rumble which may pick-up by your turntable and it also have front Gain control button.
