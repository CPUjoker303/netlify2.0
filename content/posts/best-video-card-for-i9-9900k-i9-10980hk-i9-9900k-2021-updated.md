Core i9 9900k is Intel best processor for consumers. If you are building a consumer-based system and decided to go with Intel, then i9 9900k is the best solution. The i9 9900k comes with 8 cores and 16 threads which is very powerful. In this processor, the boost clock is 5 GHz which is insane. When intel was launched i9 processors, they say that it is the fastest processor in the world and nowadays if we take a look at this processor i9 is better than Ryzen 9 only in gaming not in projectivity tasks. We have listed some Best Video Card For i9 9900k & i9 10980HK & i9 10900k.

Out of the box, this processor gives you outstanding performance, and after overclocking this processor maximum hardly 5 percent performance increase and temperature also increases so, you must have a good cooler to maintain temperature. So, if you want to overclock this processor, then you must have a good CPU cooler. 

The i9 processor is providing very solid performance, can perform any task, 4k video rendering easily. If you use Sony Vegas Pro, then Ryzen is best instead of i9 processor. If we compare Ryzen 9 with intel i9 for video rendering process using Adobe Premiere Pro, then i9 processor is faster than Ryzen 9, and if you compare both for other software, then Ryzen is providing better performance. If we talk about only gaming, then toady Intel is champion. 

The point is that in old times there are 30 to 40 fps some difference between Intel and AMD and now the difference is 5 to 6 FPS only. So technically Intel is better than AMD, but if we talk about value then AMD is 2 times better than Intel so, it depends upon you what is your choice.

	Allimiunium back plate

{{</singlep>}}

There are two different models of 2080 Dual, which are the Advanced model and OC model. The only difference is OC addition comes with higher clock speed out of the box. In the box, you get GPU with driver DVD and instruction book. 

It comes with 4352 cores. This model comes with a boost speed of 1665 MHz.  As far as memory goes, it comes with 11 GB of GDDR 6 at 14000 Mhz on a 352-bit bus, which should be plenty for most games, and it is coming with the 215 TDP, which is decently low with than the 250 TDP of the GTX 1080 Ti performance. 

The heat sink is much bigger then the previous generation, and it is just huge by comparison. It has a painted wing plate fan design. It comes with air dispel technology. This means the fans will be turned off when you are doing casual things. It has an aluminum backplate, which looks good.

It comes with a 144-hours validation process, which includes a bunch of games and benchmark, and it is a really good idea since many people are worried about buying RTX graphics card because they have heard a few stories about reliability issues and things like that, so this is a really good idea by ASUS to make people more comfortable buying their products. 

We see a single eight-pin and single six-pin and single display port, a single HDMI port, and middle there another display port and type C port. In the bottom there which is insane, and we going to see more and more companies do that now, which is display port that is the one you going to be one thing to use, so that is really good. The card size is 268 mm by 114 mm by 25 mm so, it got a decent size there and fit design with 2.7 slot design.

### EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 Super Black Gaming

	Fits on all form factors
	Massive cooling system
	Base plate design 

{{</singlep>}}

This specific variant of the card is actually really nice because it is not like huge bulky coolers on it. It fits on all form factors. The GPU has a massive cooling system. The graphic card has EVGA  ICx 2 cooling system and should be more improved over there previous ACX system. 

The heatsink is double than that 2080 ti, and the base plate design is now made more contact with the GPU components, dissipate more heat. Being that the heatsink is a lot thicker and all, it's good to know that you will lose a PCI express slot as this card covered the area of two PCI express slots. The fans are quieter than the 2080 ti and do a good job at moving air over the heatsink.

The GPU requires a six-pin, and eight-pin PCL power connector, so make sure you have appropriate connectors or adapter for your power supply as they are included with this GPU. The power supply required is 650 watt or better is also required. The overall length of this GPU is 10.62 inches or 269 mm. Just another thing to know if you are trying to fit this card into smaller cases. 

At the end of the card, you get three display ports, version 1.4 and one HDMI port version 2.lb, and best of all, you get a USB type c port, which is very useful. Nowadays, most motherboards come with USB type c port, so having an extra for phones, virtual reality devices, and external hard drives is a major bonus. The installation of this card is pretty straight forward.

	Meatl back plate 
	Red glowing non rgb Sapphire logo
	Providing excellent peroformance

{{</singlep>}}

The card looks good, and it has a proper video card design. The metal backplate looks much better. On the side, you will find a red glowing non-rgb Sapphire logo. The power connection configuration is the same one eight-pin and one six-pin PCL express power connector. The same goes for video output configuration with one HDMI and three display ports. 

For its cooler configuration, Sapphire just slapped on to this Rx 5700 XT. Basically, the same cooler setup on there RX safety 700 plus a nice big single chunk of the aluminum heatsink but with the slight upgrade, this one have five heat pipes instead of three on the RX 5700 model, although its TDP is just slightly higher compare to it as you will see later on despite having a more beefed the cooler. The RX 5700 XT version brings in higher temperatures of is GPU and surrounding components before all as the GPU voltage is around point 2 volts higher with the fan speed being mostly around 1400 to 1500 RPM, which was still very quiet.

	Insane peraformance
	Flashy back plate
	Card doesn’t have any SAG 

{{</singlep>}}

The KO is just EVGA branding for the RTX 2060. Basically RTX 2060 KO is at a very low price, and the card is supposed to come at approximately three hundred dollars plus tax. The RTX 2060 KO is providing insane performance. 

The RTX 2060 is a peculiar graphics card, and it boasts the same GPU as it is the bigger brother of 2070, but with only 1920 active Cuda cores versus 23:04 and while the 2070 sports 8 gigabytes of VRAM, which is a fair amount of card of its caliber. The RTX 2060 comes equipped with only six as memory bandwidth has reduced RTX intense cores stripped down, and TDP follows suit. The card is the first affordable RTX graphics card. It is a beautiful graphics card. A few odd quirks firstly, the eight-pin (8-pin) supplemental power connector resides on the right face of the card, which means it will face toward the front your case, and since the PCB doesn’t reach this for over, the plug is actually an extension purely a cosmetic play from Nvidia start to keep the front face clean.
