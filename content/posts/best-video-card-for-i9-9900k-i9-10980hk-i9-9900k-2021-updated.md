Core i9 9900k is Intel's best processor for consumers, and If you are building a consumer-based system and decided to go with Intel CPU, then Intel i9 9900k processor is the best solution. The 8 cores and 16 threads Intel i9 9900k listed in the top powerful CPUs in the world. 

The CPU boost clock is 5 GHz, which is insane, and when Company has launched this Intel flagship processor, they say the Intel i9 is the fastest gaming processor all over the world, and now-days, if we take a look at this processor, i9 is better than Ryzen 9 only in gaming not in projectivity tasks. We have listed Best Video Card for your best CPUs like i9 9900k & i9 10980HK & i9 10900k best value processors.

Out of the box, this Intel processor gives you outstanding raw performance. After overclocking this processor, hardly 5 percent performance increases, and temperature also increases, so you must have a good cooler to maintain temperature. So, if you want to overclock this processor, then you must have a good CPU cooler.

The Intel i9 processors (i9 9900k & i9 10980HK & i9 10900k) provide very solid performance and can perform any task, 4k video rendering easily. If you use Sony Vegas Pro, then Ryzen is best instead of an i9 processor. Let's compare Ryzen 9 with intel i9 for the video rendering process using Adobe Premiere Pro software. The i9 processor is faster than Ryzen 9, and if you compare both for other software, then Ryzen is providing better performance. If we talk about only gaming, then today Intel is champion.

## Best Video Card For i9 9900k & i9 10980HK & i9 10900k 2021

The point is that in old times there are 30 to 40 FPS some difference between Intel and AMD, and now the difference is 5 to 6 FPS only. So technically, Intel is better than AMD, but if we talk about value, then AMD is two times better than Intel so, it depends upon you what your choice is. 

The concept of pairing a low-end processor with a high-end HD GPU is bad for your PC performance, and bottlenecking issues may occur. So, If you for high-end GPUs, you must require a high-end CPU for gaming. The i9 processor is not budget-friendly and is expensive Intel CPU ever but, you don't have to go with low budget gaming processors.

### Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 

![Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti](/uploads/asus-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-dual-fan-over-clocked-review.jpg "Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti")

The video card variant comes with two different models of 2080 Dual 2x Fans, one is the Advanced model, and the second is the OC (overclocked) model. The difference between GPU models is that out of the box, the video card OC addition model has a higher clock speed and a 2.7-Slot Design. You get the best raw performance GPU with a driver DVD and a single instruction book in the box.

This video card model comes with 1650 MHz Boost Clock (OC Mode), and as far as memory goes, it comes with 11 GB of GDDR 6 at 14000MHz on a 352-bit bus, which should be plenty for most games, and GPU coming with the 250W TDP, which is decently similarly with the 250 TDP of the GTX 1080 Ti performance.

The heat sink of this best GPU is much bigger than the previous generation, and it is just huge by comparison. It has a painted wing plate fan design, and this high-end graphics card comes with Air Dispel Technology, which means the fans will be turned off when you are doing casual things. The aluminum backplate protection of 2080 Dual, looks good and the GPU comes with 4352 cores. So, this is Best Video Card For i9 9900k, Intel i9 10980HK, and i9 10900k.

It comes with a 144-hours validation process, which includes a bunch of games and benchmark test, and it is an excellent idea since many people are worried about buying RTX graphics card because they have heard a few stories about some reliability issues and things like that, so 144-hours validation process idea by NVIDIA to make people more comfortable buying their products.

GPU has a single eight-pin, single six-pin and single display port, and a single HDMI port. In the middle, there is another display port and type C port for connection. At the bottom, there is a display port, which is insane, and we are going to see more and more companies do that now; the display port is the one you are going to use, so that seems good. The card has a decent size and will fit perfectly.

This specific variant of the card is brilliant because it is not like some vast, bulky coolers. It fits all form factors, and the massive cooling system of this video card is perfect for gaming. It has an EVGA ICx 2 cooling system, which is more improved than their previous ACX system.

The GPU heatsink is double that of RTX 2080 Ti, and the designed base plate is made for contact with the Video Card components and dissipates more heat. The heatsink is much thicker and all; it’s good to know that you will lose a PCI express slot as this card covered the area of two PCI express slots.

This second-fastest GPU supports DLSS. The fans are quieter than the 2080 ti and do an excellent job at moving air over the heatsink. The GPU requires a six-pin, and eight-pin PCL power connector, so make sure that you have an appropriate connector or adapter for your power supply as they are included with this GPU.

The PSU required is 650 watts, or better is also required, and the overall length of this video card is 10.62 inches or 269 mm. At the end of the card, you get three display ports, version 1.4 and one HDMI port version 2.lb, and best of all, you get a USB type c port, which is very useful.

Nowadays, most motherboards come with a USB type c port, so having an extra for phones, virtual reality devices, and external hard drives is a significant bonus. The installation of this most affordable graphics card is pretty straight forward. So, this best value graphics card is Best Video Card For i9 9900k.

### Evga Geforce Rtx 2060 KO

![Evga Geforce Rtx 2060 KO](/uploads/evga-geforce-rtx-2060-ko-review.jpg "Evga Geforce Rtx 2060 KO")

The KO is just EVGA branding for the RTX 2060, and Basically, RTX 2060 KO is at a low price. The video card is supposed to come at approximately three hundred dollars plus tax and comes in the best affordable GPU.

The RTX 2060 is a peculiar gaming graphics card, and it boasts the same GPU as it is the bigger brother of 2070, but with only 1920 active Cuda cores versus 23:04, and while the 2070 sports 8 gigabytes of VRAM, which is a fair amount of card of its caliber. 

The RTX 2060 comes equipped with only six as memory bandwidth has reduced RTX intense cores stripped down, and TDP follows suit. It is the best cheapest GPU ever and is the first affordable RTX graphics card. 

It is a beautiful graphics card. A few odd quirks firstly, the eight-pin (8-pin) supplemental power connector resides on the right face of the card, which means it will face toward the front of your case. Since the PCB doesn’t reach this for over, the plug is an extension purely a cosmetic play from Nvidia start to keep the front face clean.

The GEFORCE RTX text has a mirror finish but glows neon green. The backplate is beautiful, highlighted in silver that seems to stand out more so than the past year's reference cards. The backplate is flashy and looks excellent. The rare i/o plate is matte black as well the following suit with its bigger brothers. The card doesn’t have any SAG at all, which is good.

### ZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 Super Mini

![ZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 Super Mini](/uploads/zotac-gaming-geforce-rtx-2070-super-mini-review.jpg "ZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 Super Mini")

Next is RTX 2070 MINI review, and the graphics card has a black and grey color scheme so, the neutral colors should help it blend in with most builds. There are two fans on the front, one is  90mm, and the other is  100mm for heat dissipation. The GPU has a brilliant metal backplate with the pre-installed ZOTAC logo.

It has a single eight-pin connector on top, and there is some white LED lighting on the top ZOTAC logo and the front above and below the center's fans. For the I/o, we got Three display port outputs, which are single HDMI 2.0 and single DVI-D outputs.

The card is on the small size, and it comes in at 21cm long and 13cm tall, and 4cm thick. The card is a dual-slot card. We got 8 GB of GDDR6 memory, which seems one of the main selling points over 2060 with 6 GB below it.

The boost clock of the GPU is 1770 MHz, and it would have been great to have another 2070 to compare the smaller one against. The card is especially capable of 1080p and 1440p resolutions even in higher settings level, 4k is ok in some, but you will probably need lower settings at 2070 for a better experience there.

Out of the box, it is providing better cooling and higher boost clocks. It is a nice option if the size is a limitation on your PC, and it is a better video card for your i9 9900k & i9 10980HK & i9 10900k.

### Sapphire Radeon Pulse RX 5600 XT

![Sapphire Radeon Pulse RX 5600 XT](/uploads/sapphire-radeon-pulse-rx-5600-xt.jpg "Sapphire Radeon Pulse RX 5600 XT")

The card is decent and pretty damn small and is as big as the pulse version of the Rx 580, and the card is more powerful than a vega 56 while under volts and overclocked while being more assertive.

It has an eight-pin connector, and the card has 6 GB of memory and a boost clock up to 1750 MHz. The card has dual fans, which feature the quick connect option, which is fantastic. If you want to quickly pop out a fan and replace it or broke one of the fan blades, or If it seizes up or wants to clean it, you can quickly do that.

The card has three display ports and a single HDMI port, and a 1-1 8 pin connector for your power supply. If we talk about the power supply, you must have at least a 500 to 550-watt power supply recommended. This one is Best Video Card For i9 9900k CPU.

Sapphire has dual bios as well, and you got a silent mode, so the fans will not spin when the video card is idealing or not working too hard. You also got a gaming mod, so if you want only to go ahead and unlock all that performance, you can do that with a physical switch.

The card is not super long, and it is only two hundred and ten millimeters long. The card can easily fit in any micro ATX and mini ATX case. The backplate is quite lovely, and it is a full aluminum backplate for protection.

### Asus TUF Gaming GeForce GTX 1650 Super Overclocked

![Asus TUF Gaming GeForce GTX 1650 Super OC](/uploads/asus-tuf-gaming-geforce-gtx-1650-super-overclocked-review.jpg "Asus TUF Gaming GeForce GTX 1650 Super OC")

The design is quite good, and the video card is very similar to the non-super version. It has an HDMI and display port connection. The card has a six-pin power connector that was not present in the non-super version. The cooling system of this graphics card is much better.

The card has 100-watt TDP versus the 75 or the non-super version. Another essential aspect of this graphics card is the encoder. If we talk about core specifications, It has 4 gigabytes of VRAM. Like the original 1650, but with the original 1650 super, it is 4 GB of G 6, the clock at 12 GB per second.

It is more accurate to call it a cut-down 1660 rather than an upgraded 1650. It is one of the strict models, and it comes in neat black styling. The card has two fans. The fans are axial tech fans, and they have a ring going around the outside, which contains the fan HSS, and this should improve overall airflow onto the heatsink itself. The two relatively large fans should do the job fine.

The card has a lovely metal backplate, and the unique feature on the 1650 super Strix that there is a fan header just on the end of the PCB so, if you have another fan in your case, maybe you have run out of headers on your motherboard, you can plug that indirectly to the graphics card itself into the PCB and have the fan speed controlled by the graphics card itself.
