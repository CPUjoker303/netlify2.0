Motherboards are famous because of their white color, and they are pure white motherboards for a white PC build. This motherboard had a black and white combination, and most of the components, including the PCB, is white. The LGA 1151 socket supports up to Intel 8th and 9th generation processors, but the h310 chipset is the primary chipset in Intel motherboards. Still, it is a great budget gaming motherboard in such a price with reliable performance and design. 

The main problem of this motherboard with most gamers is you can't overclock your components with it. For a few more bucks, you can get a good option, but overall at this price, it is not a bad deal. You might be thinking that what is interesting in this motherboard? It had an M.2 port with NVMe support, which supports data transfer rate up to 20GBPS, several USB 3.1 ports; the software package of this motherboard is also excellent.

It had plenty of fan headers and much more. For some users, there is a problem with the onboard RGB controller as it only supports red lights, but we are considering it for a white build, we don't need them. This motherboard is good in all ways, but if you can afford a few more bucks, there are some other choices too. The bad in this motherboard is only two RAM slots and one PCI slot, and it is not made for enthusiast builds. This motherboard also lacks a postcode display, so you can't get post errors on it, and it is hard to find them. Although if you don't want to spend much on the motherboard and to save money for other components, this might be a good deal for you.

If you are looking for something that's beast in performance and reasonable in price, then you can go with ASUS Prime Z390. Although this one is not a high-end motherboard, it got all features that a mid-end PC board needs.

This motherboard had a Z390 chipset and LGA 1151 socket so that you can pair Intel 9th generation i5 processor with RTX 2060 and 16GB ram with this motherboard. This motherboard had a black PCB with a white accent on it that makes it looks better than ASUS Prime Z390-A. Z390-P has two PCIe ports, but it doesn't support Nvidia SLI, so you can only use two AMD cards as Crossfire. 

It got two M.2 slots, four SATA slots, USB 3.1 support, and ASUS has its own Optimum II technology that helps you in overclocking your memory. It got four fans headers, and you are also getting a patent-pending safe slot core so that the latest GPUs don't damage the motherboard in any way. There is no RGB lighting in this motherboard, which makes it a much better deal, but for white gaming PC, it doesn't matter a lot. In my opinion, this one is beast at that price if you are looking for a white motherboard for a white gaming PC. This board is not for enthusiast builds but is still suitable for mid-range PC. Its black color with white stripes made us consider it for our white motherboard list.
