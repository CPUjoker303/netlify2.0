## What Does Poggers Emote Mean On Twitch?

Twitch is a video game streaming and broadcasting website a subsidiary of Amazon. There are expressions on twitch which are known as emotes and viewers use them to share there feelings or comments about the stream. These emote are used when something happens according to the situation. Resident Sleeper was a Twitch emote or expression which was previously used when the user's stream was so dull or not moving. It might happen when the user falls asleep during the stream or gone AFK. If you are watching such type of stream, you might leave it and find some other stream because that's going to waste your time only. What's the Origin of Resident Sleeper As the name suggests, this emote is a combination of Resident Evil and sleeping. 

A  streamer since 2008 who falls asleep during a 72-hour Resident Evil stream on September 29, 2012. It was the third try of this guy to stream Resident Evil for 72 hours, and after that, it was his last. Here is the older Pro reaction to his stream, which becomes a global emote.

Mostly streams Resident Evil, and he tried 72 hours streaming for at least three times, but this was his last try, and it became a global emote or expression on Twitch TV. If you want to check out his complete stream, you can check it on his YouTube channel. Later on, this emotes deleted by Twitch and here is the reason.

### Resident Sleeper Is Removed Why? 

 Later on, in 2016 Twitch removed Resident Sleeper as a global emote stating that
We will soon retire some older global emotes and remove or replace some others by request. For many of our older global emotes, we only have low resolution 28x28 images (and no original file to improve), and at some point in the future, this size will be relatively obsolete. This is an ongoing effort.

As of today, we have been requested to remove Resident Sleeper and Win Waker. As bummed as we are about these, we’re working on a contest for a new Resident Sleeper. We’ll be making an announcement soon
After that, no Resident Sleeper contest was happened until now.
