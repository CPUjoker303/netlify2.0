## How to use a cartridge alignment protractor?

To set this, it is pretty, straightforward and the first thing you need to do is use a [cartridge alignment](https://audio-technica.com.au/latest-news/how-to/align-turntable-cartridge/) protractor to take off your platter mat, and the reason is that the thickness of the actual protractor will represent the platter mat itself. 

Then you put an alignment protractor on it with no platter mat. Then you have to find the two areas on the protractor with a grid.  By using both of these grids, you can correctly align your cartridge.

As you know that the stylus rotates across the record surface, and the back of the stylus and cartridge assembly are never going to track every groove with the same angle, So you need to create the perfect average. 

This alignment protractor will help you to do and you have to take your stylus and then set it down right on X. You just simply look at the marks on the grid, and from a various angle, you have to try to make its determination as your cartridge is not aligned correctly. If it is squared up to the lines, then it set correctly, and there is also a line down the middle, which will help you adjust the overhang of the cartridge the front and back adjustment within the headshell assembly.

If everything lines up correctly in the first grid, you have to lift the stylus and rotate the record forward a little bit. Then you have to place it on the next one. If you see everything lines up, then you have done it, and your cartridge is aligned correctly. 

you must have to be careful because both cartridge and stylus are exceptionally delicate, and it is a precision instrument.

Now we talk about mirror surface alignment protractor, and just like the other one, you have to place the stylus on the grid. The main benefit of the cartridge mirror surface protractor is that you can look down from above and can easily see the bottom of the cartridge to help you align it and this one is beneficial when you have a large headshell that may block your view top down when you are aligning it.

### What is verticle tracking alignment?

Another very important aspect of set up your turntable is verticle tracking alignment (VTA). The acrylic block is used for not only aligning the cartridge but also setting VTA (verticle tracking alignment) of the tonearm.

### How to use an acrylic block for cartridge alignment?

First, we should have to know about what is azimuth? And how to use an acrylic block for cartridge alignment. Basically, the azimuth is the measurement of the stylus being vertical entirely up and down. When we place this acrylic block tool in front of the cartridge and getting down low and looking at it from the front will show the alignment of the azimuth.
