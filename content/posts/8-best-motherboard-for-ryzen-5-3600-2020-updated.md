The best mid-range motherboard I would recommend you is Gigabyte X570 AORUS Elite WIFI, but if you are willing to spend more on the motherboard, I would recommend you MSI MPG X570 Gaming PRO Carbon Wi-Fi."

  "@type": "Answer",

  "text": "The best chipset motherboard for Ryzen 5 3600 you can get right now is x570 because of the presence of PCIe Gen4 and M.2 Gen4 slots. But we all know that these motherboards are a bit expensive if you are using any processor under $200-$250 and it applies to all of the motherboards from this chipset. Those users who want something below than x570 chipset motherboards and can compromise on all features mentioned above can go with x470 chipset motherboards. Also, Ryzen 5 3600 is compatible with the B450 chipset motherboard, but there you might lose much like PCI Gen4, SLI support, and decent VRM cooling for this processor."

  "text": "The best budget motherboard for Ryzen 5 3600 can be MSI B450 Tomahawk as this one comes with support for Ryzen 3000 CPUs out of the box. Also, it features every necessary thing to build your PC, but you can only run this processor on stock clocks with this motherboard. While for high-end or enthusiasts build the best motherboard can be the Gigabyte X570 AORUS Elite WIFI as it offers every premium feature and doesnâ€™t lack everything. Also, we have mentioned some other best motherboards for this processor which you can get for the wallet-friendly price without compromising on features."
